Since there aren't many squeezenet written by tensorflow, and the "Community adoption of SqueezeNet" mentioned in https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet doesn't include a tensorflow version, a squeezenet framework in tensorflow for readability is shown here. Moreover, it's an example of using Successive Halving algorithm to finish hyperparameters optimization. If you want to know more details about hyperparameters optimization using SH algorithm, please read the paper "Non-stochastic Best Arm Identification and Hyperparameter Optimization" by Kevin Jamieson and Ameet Talwalkar. The training code may seems a little longer than normal NN-training process because we need to consider more under SH framework. We use CIFAR-10 as dataset and our target is image classifying. We at last give a demo, but there may exists better options of parameters used on our code.
